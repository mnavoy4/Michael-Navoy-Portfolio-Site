        <p>
          I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Petroleum Engineering and I worked
          as a petroleum engineer for a little over
          2 years before making my career transition into software engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering program where I focused on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.
          I have experience with React, React Navtive, NodeJS, Redux, MongoDB, SQLite3, and MySQL.

        <p>
          I love getting outdoors as much as possible by snowboarding/skiing in the winter and hiking with my dog Zella in the summer.
